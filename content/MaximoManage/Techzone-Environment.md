   You will almost immediately receive an email notifying that your environment has begun provisioning. After 5-10 minutes, you’ll receive another email notifying you that your environment is ready, with details on how to access it.


   **Caution:** The maximum duration for reserving this demo environment is 3 days (72 hours). Please try and complete this demo script within that time to avoid losing demo access before completion.

8. Once you receive an email notifying you that your environment is ready to use, locate the URL link in this email for the demo environment **MAS v8.9 Demo Environment URL** and the list of corresponding login credentials. This URL and login credentials will be used later in the demo script.
